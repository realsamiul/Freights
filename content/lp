**Demo 1: HAWKEYE Geospatial Intelligence**

**Title:** Physics-Informed Flood Mapping  
**Metric:** 91% mIoU, 30-Minute Pipeline

**Technical Summary:**  
SegFormer-B2 hierarchical vision transformer trained on physics-generated pseudo-labels. Fusion of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter (VV < -18 dB identifies smooth water), Sentinel-2 NDWI ((B3-B8)/(B3+B8) > 0.1 for moisture), and SRTM slope constraints (< 2.86° for gravitational drainage). Achieved 94.2% precision and 95.7% recall on Brahmaputra 2020 holdout validation, processing 2,847 km² scenes in 8 minutes on CPU—336× faster than manual GIS methods.

**Metric:** 30% Downtime Reduction, 72-Hour Lead Time

**Technical Summary:**  
FATE 1.11 framework implementing FedAvg algorithm with Paillier homomorphic encryption (2048-bit keys) and differential privacy (ε=1.0). Raspberry Pi 4 edge devices ($50 each) run 5M-parameter bidirectional LSTM models locally on tri-axial accelerometer (1kHz), PT100 RTD temperature (±0.1°C), and acoustic data (20Hz-20kHz). Only encrypted gradients (~2MB) transmit to central aggregation server. Pilot across 5 garment factories achieved 85% failure prediction precision with 68-hour mean warning lead time.

**Demo 3: HYPERION Disease Forecasting**

**Title:** Causal Time-Series Intelligence  
**Metric:** 9.8% MAPE (7-day), 6 Causal Features Identified

**Technical Summary:**  
Combines Facebook Prophet (additive seasonality modeling) with Tigramite's PCMCI algorithm for lag-specific causal discovery across 36 covariates. Identified statistically significant causal lag structures: maximum temperature leads dengue cases by 14 days (r=0.324, p<0.001), while VIIRS nightlight radiance (economic activity proxy) shows inverse correlation (r=-0.574) at zero lag. Outperforms univariate ARIMA by 32% and Prophet-only baseline by 18% on 7-day forecasts.

**Demo 4: Trade Intelligence**

**Title:** Ensemble Freight Rate Prediction  
**Metric:** 0.81 R² (7-day), Proprietary Feature Engineering

**Technical Summary:**  
Stacked ensemble of CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization via Optuna. Engineered proprietary "Trade Imbalance Ratio" feature (import-export container differential per route-week) accounting for 38% of CatBoost model's predictive power. Achieved R²=0.8069 on 7-day horizons with MAE=$611, outperforming baseline econometric models (ARIMA, Ridge regression) by 41%.

### **[STRATEGIC VISION]**

**Section Title:** From Validated Demos to Regional AI Infrastructure

***

**Block 1: Foundation Model Arbitrage**

Allen AI invested $2M training SatlasPretrain on 302M satellite images. We fine-tune their open-source Swin-v2-Base encoder on 10,000 Bangladesh-specific tiles for $150 in compute—achieving 15-20% accuracy gains on local flood/landslide/urban segmentation tasks. Microsoft's LayoutLMv3 and Google's ChemBERTa follow the same pattern: leverage billion-dollar pre-training, add irreplaceable regional data, dominate emerging markets.

***

**Block 2: Edge-First Architecture**

Our systems run on $50 Raspberry Pi devices via ONNX Runtime with INT8 quantization, achieving <200ms inference latency and 30 FPS throughput on ARM CPUs. Federated learning via FATE framework ensures 99% of computation happens on-premise, reducing cloud dependency and respecting data sovereignty—critical for Bangladesh's unreliable power grid and factory proprietary data.

***

**Block 3: Physics-Informed Generalization**

Standard neural networks memorize patterns; physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) embed conservation laws directly into loss functions. Our flood model penalizes predictions violating hydrological constraints (∂h/∂t + ∇·(hv) = 0 for shallow water continuity), forcing generalization to unseen river basins. This principle extends to epidemiological compartmental models (SIR dynamics) and market microstructure (no-arbitrage conditions).
