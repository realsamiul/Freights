Here are the complete, website‑ready technical report contents for the LPG Demand and Freight Rates demos, matching the accepted structure and depth.[1]

### LPG — Summary
HYPERION LPG Demand Forecasting converts monthly national consumption data into accurate, seasonality‑aware forecasts using XGBoost, capturing long‑term upward trend and predictable annual cycles for planning and inventory optimization.[2]
The pipeline standardizes inputs, engineers temporal/seasonal features, validates via time‑series CV and holdout evaluation, and outputs monthly demand with confidence bands for production and logistics scheduling.[2]

### LPG — Scope of project
Provide repeatable, reliable monthly LPG demand forecasts at national scale, optimized for annual budgeting, inventory right‑sizing, and refinery run‑planning with minimal maintenance overhead.[2]
The workflow targets clean ingestion, robust feature design (trend, seasonality, lags), and operational artifacts (CSV forecasts, model configs, feature importance, and monitoring hooks).[2]

### LPG — Intention and objectives
- Deliver defensible monthly forecasts that resolve trend and seasonal structure for production, pricing, and stock decisions.[2]
- Reduce waste and stockouts by aligning inbound supply and storage with anticipated demand cycles across the year.[2]

### LPG — Datasets used
- Monthly LPG consumption series from national energy statistics agencies, with validation and outlier screening prior to modeling.[1]
- Temporal covariates derived from calendar metadata, including month, quarter, and Fourier seasonal terms; optional weather proxies where available.[1]

### LPG — Variables targeted
- Target: Monthly LPG volume (national aggregate), optionally normalized per‑capita for structural comparability.[2]
- Predictors: Time index, seasonal Fourier bases, trend terms, and lagged consumption features at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.[1]

### LPG — Method and pipeline
- Preprocessing: Normalize, align, and validate monthly series; apply outlier detection and imputation rules only under tight thresholds.[2]
- Feature engineering: Concatenate trend, seasonal, and lagged terms to expose multi‑scale dynamics to tree‑based learners.[1]
- Modeling: XGBoost trained with time‑series CV and final evaluation on a recent holdout to confirm generalization prior to deployment.[2]

### LPG — Core formulas
- Fourier seasonality (annual): $$ s_{k}(t) = a_{k}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi kt}{12}\right) + b_{k}\cos\left(\frac{2\pi kt}{12}\right) $$ with small $$k$$ for smooth cycles.[1]
- MAPE: $$ \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}\left|\frac{y_{t}-\hat{y}_{t}}{y_{t}}\right| $$ as a primary interpretability metric for monthly demand. [1]  
- RMSE: $$ \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}(y_{t}-\hat{y}_{t})^{2}} $$ for absolute error benchmarking.[1]

### LPG — Python snippets
- Feature construction (trend, seasonality, lags) and XGBoost fit:[1]
```python
t = np.arange(len(y))
month = pd.Series(index=y.index, data=y.index.month)
# Fourier seasonality
k = 2
S = []
for j in range(1, k+1):
    S.append(np.sin(2*np.pi*j*t/12))
    S.append(np.cos(2*np.pi*j*t/12))
fourier = np.vstack(S).T
# Lags
X = pd.DataFrame({"t": t, "month": month})
for L in [1,3,6,12]:
    X[f"y_lag_{L}"] = y.shift(L)
X = X.join(pd.DataFrame(fourier, index=y.index).add_prefix("f"))
X_train, y_train = X.dropna(), y.loc[X.dropna().index]
model = xgb.XGBRegressor(max_depth=6, n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.05)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### LPG — Results obtained
- Fit quality: Strong correlation between actual and predicted consumption with robust holdout performance and consistent annual seasonality captured.[2]
- Business readiness: Forecasts ship with confidence intervals, feature importance, and configuration for retraining and monitoring.[2]

### LPG — Meaning and decision relevance
- Translating seasonality and trend into forward signals allows right‑sizing inventory, smoothing refinery schedules, and stabilizing cash‑flow planning.[2]
- Operational visibility reduces overstock/stockout risk during peak‑demand months and supports price and promotion calendars.[2]

### LPG — Technical briefs
- XGBoost’s non‑linear splits capture interactions between lags and seasonal bases that linear models often miss, while remaining controllable via regularization.[1]
- Time‑series cross‑validation and holdout evaluation protect against regime‑specific overfitting before monthly production release.[2]

### LPG — Operationalization and outputs
- Deliverables: Monthly forecast CSV/Parquet with intervals, model artifacts, feature importance, and validation reports for governance.[2]
- Integration: Batch retrain and monthly publish to dashboard/API with monitoring hooks for drift and error thresholds.[2]

### LPG — Limitations and risks
- Structural shifts (policy, subsidies, shocks) can change elasticities; monitoring and rapid recalibration are mandatory.[2]
- Data quality and latency limit horizon extension; uncertainty bands expand meaningfully beyond a few quarters.[2]

### LPG — Future scope
- Regional disaggregation, price elasticity modeling, and weather‑sensitive variants for cold‑snap scenarios.[1]
- Multi‑product extension (CNG/diesel/gasoline) on the same feature scaffolding and production pipeline.[1]

### Freight — Summary
HYPERION Freight Forecasting achieves 7‑day R² of 0.70 and MAE of 611 USD/TEU on Far East→US West Coast rates by leveraging a proprietary Trade Imbalance Ratio feature and time‑series validated gradient‑boosted models.[3]
The system produces 7/14/30‑day forecasts, with 14‑day R² of 0.50 for operational planning and 30‑day directional guidance, all backed by a foundry of benchmarked algorithms and rigorous backtesting.[3]

### Freight — Scope of project
Provide lane‑specific short‑ and mid‑term freight rate forecasts that support procurement timing, contract negotiation, and risk hedging under volatile market regimes.[3]
Focus on robust out‑of‑sample performance and explainability via feature importance and domain‑grounded indicators rather than opaque black‑box signals.[3]

### Freight — Intention and objectives
- Move from reactive price‑taking to proactive strategy using defensible, horizon‑specific forecasts and early‑warning indicators.[3]
- Codify domain intuition (capacity tension, fuel, demand imbalances) into predictive features with strict leakage controls.[3]

### Freight — Datasets used
- Lane rates: Far East→US West Coast and reciprocal lane (eastbound/westbound) for imbalance measures, daily since 2018.[3]
- Market proxies: Dry bulk index proxy and Brent fuel prices to capture capacity and cost dynamics across macro conditions.[3]

### Freight — Variables targeted
- Targets: Daily USD/TEU rates at 7/14/30‑day horizons; evaluation on R² and MAE with time‑series splits.[3]
- Predictors: Lagged rates (1/7/14/30), fuel and index lags, and the Trade Imbalance Ratio and its lags to encode capacity tension.[3]

### Freight — Method and pipeline
- Feature engineering: Compute FEUW/UWFE ratio and multi‑lag stacks; exclude contemporaneous target to prevent leakage.[3]
- Model foundry: Ridge, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost benchmarked per horizon with backtesting and holdout.[3]
- Selection: XGBoost champions 7‑day; LightGBM strong on 14‑day; ensemble diagnostics retained.[3]

### Freight — Key signals
- Trade Imbalance Ratio $$ \text{TIR} = \frac{\text{FEUW}}{\text{UWFE}} $$: higher values precede rate spikes when eastbound demand dominates return capacity.[3]
- Market and fuel lags transmit macro and cost pressures; lane‑specific lags capture momentum and mean‑reversion.[3]

### Freight — Core formulas
- R²: $$ R^{2} = 1 - \frac{\sum (y-\hat{y})^{2}}{\sum (y-\bar{y})^{2}} $$, primary variance‑explanation metric for horizon benchmarking.[3]
- MAE: $$ \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum |y-\hat{y}| $$, procurement‑aligned error in USD/TEU. [3]  
- Trade Imbalance Ratio: $$ \text{TIR}_{t} = \frac{\text{FEUW}_{t}}{\text{UWFE}_{t}} $$, with lag features $$ \text{TIR}_{t-L} $$.[3]

### Freight — Python snippets
- Feature assembly with ratio and lags:[3]
```python
df["tir"] = df["feuw"]/df["uwfe"]
lags = [1,7,14,30]
for col in ["feuw","uwfe","bdi_proxy","brent","tir"]:
    for L in lags:
        df[f"{col}_lag_{L}"] = df[col].shift(L)
features = [c for c in df.columns if "lag_" in c]
```
- XGBoost training and evaluation (7‑day):[3]
```python
X = df[features].iloc[:-7].dropna()
y = df["feuw"].shift(-7).iloc[:-7].loc[X.index]
model = xgb.XGBRegressor(max_depth=6, n_estimators=400, learning_rate=0.05)
model.fit(X, y)
yhat = model.predict(X_test)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, yhat); mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, yhat)
```

### Freight — Results obtained
- 7‑day: $$ R^{2}=0.70 $$, $$ \text{MAE}=611 $$ USD/TEU; 14‑day: $$ R^{2}=0.50 $$; 30‑day: directional guidance under higher uncertainty.[3]
- Data coverage: 2,698 daily records processed with real‑time pipeline hooks and automated QC for production readiness.[3]

### Freight — Meaning and decision relevance
- Forecasts enable rate‑lock timing, spot vs. contract trade‑offs, and budget sensitivity analysis ahead of volatility bursts.[3]
- TIR provides interpretable, lane‑physics‑aligned signal that generalizes across regimes better than naive momentum alone.[3]

### Freight — Technical briefs
- Time‑series splits and leakage controls are enforced; horizon‑specific champions avoid one‑size‑fits‑all degradation.[3]
- Tree ensembles capture nonlinear interactions among fuel, macro proxies, and lane imbalances while retaining feature attributions.[1]

### Freight — Operationalization and outputs
- Deliverables: 7/14/30‑day forecasts (CSV), confidence, feature importance, and backtesting reports for governance.[3]
- Integration: Live ingestion, automated serving, monitoring for regime breaks, and alerting when predicted spikes exceed thresholds.[3]

### Freight — Limitations and risks
- Structural regime shifts or data feed issues require prompt recalibration; accuracy diminishes beyond 30‑day horizons.[3]
- Market microstructure changes can modify TIR elasticities; periodic re‑estimation preserves edge.[3]

### Freight — Future scope
- Multi‑lane expansion (EU–Asia, Trans‑Pacific variants), real‑time API, and contract optimization decision support.[3]
- Alerting and what‑if simulators for fuel shock or capacity‑shock scenarios using stress‑tested ensembles.[3]
