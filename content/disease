Here is the complete, website‑ready technical report content for the Disease (Dengue Early‑Warning) demo, matching the accepted structure and depth.[1]

### Summary
HAWKEYE Disease Intelligence fuses epidemiology, weather, demographics, and satellite context to forecast dengue with 7‑day MAPE of 9.8% for Dhaka while revealing a strong urban metabolism link via nightlights, enabling policy actions up to two weeks in advance.[2]
The system integrates 30+ datasets with rigorous preprocessing and delivers nowcasts, risk maps, and intervention windows as API outputs for health operations centers.[2]

### Scope of project
Provide city‑scale dengue incidence forecasts and risk alerts with weekly cadence, operationalized for Dhaka (2022–2025), and designed for replication across districts through standardized data adapters and harmonized feature schemas.[2]
The deployment pairs statistical forecasting with causal signal analysis to keep models interpretable and resilient to shifting data quality across municipal sources.[1]

### Intention and objectives
- Deliver reliable 7‑day dengue forecasts and risk tiers that drive resource allocation, vector control scheduling, and clinical surge planning.[2]
- Quantify leading indicators (temperature, rainfall, humidity, radiance) and produce defensible explanations for public‑health briefings and after‑action reviews.[1]

### Datasets used
- Health surveillance: Weekly dengue case counts and population‑normalized rates compiled for Dhaka wards and aggregates.[2]
- Environmental: Daily temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pressure used as lagged regressors for vector ecology dynamics.[2]
- Geospatial: VIIRS nightlights radiance as an urban activity proxy and mobility surrogate; satellite basemaps for optional cartographic context.[2]
- Administrative and demographics: Ward boundaries and population density layers for normalization and targeting.[2]
- Data coverage and quality: 1,105 temporal records, 36 fused features, 0.16% missing data after harmonization.[3]

### Variables targeted
- Targets: Weekly dengue cases and incidence per 100k population to stabilize across demographic differences.[2]
- Predictors: Lagged weather covariates, nightlights aggregates, month/seasonality flags, and holiday/behavioral proxies where available.[2]

### Method and pipeline
- Ingestion and QA: Standardize sources, fix calendar alignments, forward‑fill short gaps under strict caps, and verify monotonic ward aggregations for totals.[2]
- Feature engineering: Create 7–28‑day lags for temperature, humidity, and rainfall, plus rolling means and anomalies; aggregate nightlights monthly and align to epidemiological weeks.[2]
- Forecasting layer: Prophet‑based univariate core with exogenous regressors where supported, backed by gradient‑boosted tabular models for sensitivity and ablation analysis.[2]

### Key signals and lags
- Temperature→Dengue: Pearson $$ r=0.324 $$ with 14‑day lag, $$ p\ll 0.001 $$, consistent with vector development cycles.[3]
- Socio‑economic modulation: Nightlights as activity proxy correlates strongly with GDP $$ r=0.88 $$, informing contact patterns and exposure risk in urban cores.[2]
- Data sufficiency: 36 features with low missingness enable robust cross‑validation and ablation checks on dominant drivers.[3]

### Modeling framework
- Forecast core: Prophet with weekly seasonality, holiday effects where available, and tuned changepoint prior; exogenous covariates engineered as lags and anomalies.[2]
- Benchmark ensemble: Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) for tabular regressions on lagged features to verify stability and capture nonlinearities.[1]
- Early‑warning horizon: Policy window up to 14 days to stage spraying, larval source reduction, and ward staffing changes.[1]

### Core formulas
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error: $$ \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}\left|\frac{y_{t}-\hat{y}_{t}}{y_{t}}\right| $$, primary evaluation at 7‑day horizon. [2]  
- Lagged covariance check: $$ \text{Corr}\big(T_{t-14},\,\text{Dengue}_{t}\big)=0.324 $$ validating thermal lead against cases.[3]
- Growth rate week‑over‑week: $$ g_{t} = \frac{y_{t}-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} $$ used for surge detection and thresholded alerting.[2]

### Python script snippets (illustrative)
- Lag feature construction and merges:
```python
df["temp_lag_14"] = df["temp"].shift(14)
df["hum_lag_14"]  = df["humidity"].shift(14)
df["rain_lag_14"] = df["rain"].shift(14)
df["nl_month"]    = nightlights.resample("W").mean().reindex(df.index, method="ffill")
features = ["temp_lag_14","hum_lag_14","rain_lag_14","nl_month"]
```

- Prophet with weekly seasonality and regressors:
```python
m = Prophet(weekly_seasonality=True, yearly_seasonality=True)
for col in features:
    m.add_regressor(col, standardize=True)
fit = m.fit(df.rename(columns={"cases":"y","date":"ds"}))
forecast = m.predict(df_future)  # 7-day horizon
```

- Gradient boosting benchmark:
```python
X = df[features].shift(1).dropna()
y = df["cases"].loc[X.index]
model = xgb.XGBRegressor(max_depth=6, n_estimators=400, learning_rate=0.05)
model.fit(X, y)
yhat = model.predict(df_future[features])
```

### Results obtained
- Forecast accuracy: 7‑day MAPE $$=9.8\%$$ on Dhaka, meeting decision‑grade thresholds for weekly operational planning.[2]
- Leading indicators: Statistically significant temperature→dengue link at 14‑day lag $$ r=0.324 $$ with $$ N=1105 $$, $$ p\ll 0.001 $$.[3]
- Data integrity: Fused urban dataset exhibits 0.16% missingness, enabling stable training and fewer imputations.[3]

### Meaning and decision relevance
- A sub‑10% 7‑day MAPE allows ward‑level resource staging, outpatient staffing changes, and targeted vector control before peak incidence weeks.[2]
- Causal‑consistent thermal lag supports public guidance on heat/rainfall vigilance windows and aligns with entomological cycles for intervention timing.[3]
- Nightlights‑informed context connects activity intensity with exposure risk, guiding surveillance routing toward likely transmission corridors.[2]

### Technical briefs (what makes it work)
- Harmonized lags and anomalies convert noisy weather streams into biologically meaningful regressors while preserving interpretability.[2]
- Dual‑track modeling (Prophet + boosted trees) provides both transparent baselines and non‑linear capture for robustness under changing behaviors.[1]
- Low missingness and consistent ward delineations reduce label noise and improve week‑ahead stability.[3]

### Operationalization and outputs
- Deliverables: Weekly nowcasts with 80/95% intervals, ward risk tiers, surge alerts, and feature attributions for briefing decks and dashboards.[2]
- Integration: Batch ETL refreshes sources weekly and publishes forecasts and risks to the Urban Intelligence API and Vercel dashboards.[1]

### Limitations and risks
- Reporting artifacts: Case backlog dumps and testing policy shifts can transiently break stationarity; outlier detection and robust losses mitigate but do not remove risk.[2]
- Exogenous shocks: Mobility restrictions or blackouts alter transmission dynamics; models require rapid recalibration using recent windows.[2]
- Transferability: Elasticities and optimal lags vary by microclimate; city‑specific validation is required when scaling nationally.[2]

### Future scope
- Entomological integration: Fuse mosquito trap counts and vector suitabilities for mechanistic hybrid models.[1]
- Spatial diffusion: Graph‑based spillover modeling between wards using mobility or road‑network priors.[2]
- Active monitoring: Alerting when thermal/rainfall precursors cross city‑specific thresholds to trigger pre‑emptive operations.[2]
